## Data Modelling

To optimize the performance of the data model, a calender  table was created using DAX functions. However, the dimension tables are not connected to the corresponding DAX table. The diagram below illustrates the data model.

### **Conclusion:**

This marketing campaign has shown promising results, particularly in the Fall season and on platforms like Instagram and Pinterest. The data suggests that continued focus on mobile-optimized ads, discount-based campaigns, and leveraging high-performing platforms will deliver the best returns. Regional targeting in cities like Manchester and Birmingham, along with a heavy focus on the Fall season, will drive future growth.

   
### **Recommendations:**

1. **Focus on Mobile-Optimized Campaigns:**
   - With mobile leading impressions, campaigns should prioritize mobile-first content, including optimized landing pages and mobile-friendly ads to capture maximum audience attention and engagement.

2. **Prioritize Discount Ads:**
   - Given that discount ads contributed to **62% of total sales**, increasing the use of discount offers could further boost sales across all platforms. The effectiveness of discounts should also be tested across different audience segments and regions for tailored results.

3. **Strengthen Instagram and Pinterest Strategy:**
   - Instagram and Pinterest were highly efficient, yielding high profits with lower ad spend. Expanding ad investment into these channels could further enhance ROAS and drive more cost-effective results.
   - Since Pinterest had the lowest ad spend but high returns, it could be leveraged for niche, visual, or product-based marketing.

4. **Optimize Facebook Ads for Cost Efficiency:**
   - Although Facebook had the highest engagement, it suffered from lower profitability. The cost-per-engagement was high, suggesting that Facebook ads should be optimized either by targeting a more focused audience or by reducing ad spend to increase profitability.

5. **Maximize Seasonal Campaigns:**
   - The Fall campaign clearly outperformed others, both in sales and impressions. Campaigns launched in the fall should be prioritized and perhaps extended in duration or spend.
   - Tailoring content seasonally, especially in the Fall, to align with customer interests (e.g., holiday offers) could amplify results.

6. **Regional Focused Ads:**
   - As Manchester leads in sales, efforts to amplify campaigns in this location should be prioritized. It could involve localized ads, geo-targeting, or even exclusive regional offers.
   - Strengthening the presence in Birmingham and London can also boost sales through more localized campaigns.

7. **Increase Engagement and Conversion in Peak Months:**
   - September to November have shown to be high-traffic months. Ensuring that ad copy, promotions, and call-to-actions are aligned with this surge can result in better conversions.
   - Focus on improving the engagement-to-conversion rate, particularly for high-impression months like October and November, where engagement was strong but conversion rates fell.

**By addressing these recommendations, the aviation industry can continue to improve safety outcomes and reduce the risk of future airplane crashes.**
##  <a name='Actionablesteps'></a> Actionable Steps
1. Increase budget allocation for mobile ads across Instagram and Pinterest for higher ROI.
2. Expand the use of discount-based advertising campaigns, particularly in the Fall season, to capitalize on consumer spending patterns.
3. Reevaluate Facebook's ad strategy, focusing on cost-cutting or more targeted campaigns to improve profit margins.
4. Ensure that future campaigns, particularly during September-November, focus on maximizing conversion rates, especially for months that historically show high impressions but low conversions.


##  <a name='ConsequencesofInaction'></a>Consequences of Inaction
- **Failure to optimize mobile campaigns** may result in missing out on a significant portion of the audience that engages primarily through mobile devices, thus losing potential sales and impressions.
- **Not capitalizing on Fall’s seasonal impact** could mean missing opportunities for maximum revenue generation, as historical data indicates Fall as the highest-performing season.
- **Continuing with Facebook’s current ad spend without optimization** may lead to wasted budget, as engagement is not translating into profits efficiently, hurting overall profitability.
- **Lack of discount campaigns** would result in lower sales, as customers are evidently more responsive to discounts, and ignoring this may lead to a lower conversion rate and overall revenue.


By taking the necessary actions, the company can build on its current successes and address inefficiencies, ensuring long-term growth and profitability.
